__Original Celestia Medium Redux Story.__
_A breif history of why this font exists._

(As I know it anyway)

There is a cartoon show called 'My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic', I happen to have fallen into it's unanticipated fanbase (the 'Bronies').

The show's logo contains text that uses a font called Generation B, as produced by Harold Lohner and it's available to purchase for $20 here(http://www.fontbros.com/cgi-bin/commerce.cgi?preadd=action&key=HAFO-GENB).

Fans began to produce their own material (artwork/videos/websites/games/etc.) based upon the show and they thought it would be great if the text that appeared in their material could look like that in the show's logo.

As such, at some point in time, a replica image was produced and released onto an image board that contained more or less a trace of the text in the logo. This image was used by someone named Purple Tinker as a basis for the original Celestia Medium font.

Some people began to pick up on, and question the morality/legality behind working on a 'knock-off' of a commercial font, as a consequence work upon the original Celestia Medium stopped, as too did it's (regular) availability.

It was at this point I stepped in.

I managed to track down a copy of Celestia Medium, and decided I'd work it into a less legally questionable 'fanbased' form. From the original font file I exported each of the available glyphs as an SVG and reworked them in Inkscape (and also produced several new ones).

This allowed me to make the redux different from the original and also, hopefully, made it distinctive from Generation B.

I should also point out, that before I did start the redux, I asked Harold Lohner if he didn't want me to, he gave me the very clear line of 'please don't rework the Generation B files', which I can't.


_I guess it was inevitable..._

Some of you may wonder about the license that this font is under. And the tl:dr version is it's public domain, so you can freely use it how you want, you can freely redistribute it, and you can freely modify it.

The reason why public domain is below:

PurpleTinker released Celestia Medium as public domain prior to ceasing work on it, and since I did work the files directly this means I didn't generate any 'original' content, and so legally I have to release it under the same license.

I've never looked through any open source license in entirety, nor do I know the specifics of public domain, but from what I have come across - public domain feels the 'nice'-est of all licenses available, mainly because of the freedom it offers to anyone whom interacts with the content. The various strings attached to various copyleft materials/licenses detract from the apparent freedom they offer, and as someone who doesn't like strings I find this makes copyleft less attractive as a license.

That being said, I find many more complaints with how most copyright licenses are written. It has become the norm for most purchases of digital content to be a purchase of the license which grants you permission to use the content they cover, and not, in fact, a purchase of the content itself.

Allow me to give an example:
In the real world, if I purchase a deck of cards, I get a deck of cards, I'll have about 55 in total, and I can do whatever I want to those cards, and if they're still intact after I'm finished with them, I can sell them on to someone else to enjoy.

In the digital world I purchase a card game from the internet, what I purchase allows me 5 installations of said game. This alone informs me that I can press the 'accept license terms' a total of 5 times, any attempts with the same license code afterwards will fail, this mean my purchase is actually a purchase of 5 copies of the license, and not 5 copies of the game, otherwise I'd have to download the game files 5 times. The license will also make it illegal to change any parts of the game files, unlike the physical copy which I can change. The license also prevents liability to the publisher/manufacturer of the game should it cause damage to my computer, again unlike the physical copy, which if found to contain anything dangerous must be recalled by the seller/manufacturer by law. And most licenses purchase for digital downloads make it illegal to resell any unused copies of the license code.

So those are the reasons why this is public domain.

I don't know why you'd want to redistribute the font though, I'll be keeping it up for as long as I have hosting, which I don't plan on changing for a while yet.
